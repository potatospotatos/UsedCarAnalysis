# UsedCarAnalysis

An analysis of a dataset of 426000 cars to determine what consumers value in a used car.

Findings:

1. Vehicle Age: Newer cars retain more value; older cars depreciate quickly.
2. Odometer: Lower mileage correlates with higher prices.
3. Manufacturer: Brands like Toyota, Honda, Subaru retain value best.
4. Transmission & Drive: Automatic and AWD/4WD vehicles can boost price.
5. Title Status: Clean titles are worth significantly more.

Recommendations

- Focus on low-mileage, recent model cars from value-retaining brands.
- Avoid rebuilt/salvage titles unless deeply discounted.
- Use the model to help assess fair pricing in real time.
- Consider regional preferences for AWD/4WD vehicles.
